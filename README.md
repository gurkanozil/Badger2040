# Badger2040 Project

Welcome to the Badger2040 project! This project is built using MicroPython and the Thonny IDE and is designed to work with the Badger2040 hardware. It includes a variety of custom applications that enhance the functionality of the device.

## Features

- **MicroPython**: The project leverages MicroPython, a lean implementation of Python 3 designed to run on microcontrollers and in constrained environments.
  
- **Custom Applications**: The project includes several custom applications, such as:
  - **Draw**: An application that allows users to create and manipulate drawings on the e-ink display.
  - **Screenshot**: A utility that captures the current display and saves it for later use.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Badger2040 project, ensure you have a MicroPython Interpreter installed on your device.
I use the Thonny IDE as recommended by the Pimoroni.
You can find the installation instructions on the [Thonny website](https://thonny.org/).

### Running the Applications

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Upload the desired application files to your Badger2040 device.
3. Run the applications in the IDE and the results will be shown on your Badger2040.
